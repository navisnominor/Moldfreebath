  name: Two-Stage Mold Risk Dehumidifier Control with Multiple Entities
  description: >
    Two-stage dehumidification that uses a risk index (e.g., from the mold_risk_index integration)
    along with optional humidity and temperature sensors for reference.
    The fan(s) turn on immediately when the risk exceeds the fan threshold.
    If the risk remains above the dehumidifier threshold for a set delay, the dehumidifier(s) turn on.
    Both devices are turned off only after low-risk readings persist.
    Nighttime behavior can be modified independently.
